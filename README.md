# BI622: Index Hopping

**Sally Claridge**

*Due 13 September 2017*

Here is a brief description of what is in all of the files I have added to this repository:
- `index_hopping.Rmd`: All of my comments, responses, plots, and non-python code in an R markdown format (not knitted, so in raw format)
- `index_hopping.html`: Same as above, but this will open as a webpage
  - I like this format the best, aesthetically, but I had problems viewing it in GitHub.
  - If you use the GitHub web address for this file [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/), you can view it.
  - There is also a PDF version of this file in case this option doesn't work for you.
- `index_hopping.pdf`: Same as above, but is knitted to a PDF
- `index_hopping2.py`: Python script that documents index hopping
- `stats_onefile.py`: Python script that produces mean quality score distributions for a single FASTQ file
